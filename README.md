Random-ABCs is a collection of:

- Random generators for numbers, colors, names, countries, texts, groups, etc.

- Utilities for loading, parsing, and manipulating data structures like JSON, CSV, e.g. JSON-to-CSV, CSV-to-JSON, JSON viewer, Markdown editor/viewer etc.

It is a collection of tools that I use in my daily work. I hope you find it useful too.
